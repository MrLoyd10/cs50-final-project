## Project Description

QuickGrade is an innovative web application developed to address the grading challenges faced by elementary school teachers. With a focus on simplicity, security, and customization, QuickGrade empowers educators to efficiently manage student grades, ultimately contributing to a more effective and stress-free teaching experience.

### Key Features

#### Secure Login and Registration

QuickGrade prioritizes the security of user data. The application features a robust login system, ensuring that only authorized users have access to student records and grading functionalities. Registration is a straightforward process, requiring minimal information to create an account.

#### Customizable Grading Criteria

Recognizing the diverse assessment methods used by teachers, QuickGrade allows for the customization of grading criteria. Teachers can set the percentage weights for different evaluation components such as performance in class, seatwork, recitation, and exams. This flexibility enables educators to tailor the grading system to align with their specific teaching methods and curriculum requirements.

#### Editable Records for Minimized Errors

To accommodate changes or corrections, QuickGrade allows easy editing of student records. This feature is crucial in minimizing human errors in the grading process. Teachers can update student information, ensuring that the system reflects the most accurate and up-to-date records.

#### Automated Calculation for Time Efficiency

One of QuickGrade's standout features is its automated grading calculation system. After entering grades for each student based on the predefined criteria, the application automatically computes the final grades. This not only saves teachers significant time but also ensures accuracy in the grading process, reducing the likelihood of manual calculation errors.

### Intuitive User Experience

QuickGrade boasts an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The navigation is designed to be straightforward, making it accessible for teachers with varying levels of technical expertise. The application's layout promotes efficiency in accessing and inputting grading information.

## Conclusion

QuickGrade is a web application built with Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sqlite and Bootstrap, designed to simplify the grading process for elementary school teachers. This project was developed as the final submission for the CS50 course, and it represents a significant milestone in my programming journey.

Throughout the development of QuickGrade, I had the opportunity to delve into various technologies and programming concepts. The integration of Flask for the backend, HTML and CSS for frontend design, and JavaScript with Bootstrap for a responsive user interface provided a comprehensive learning experience.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to CS50 and Professor David Malan for their guidance and the wealth of knowledge shared throughout the course. This project not only showcases technical skills but also reflects the valuable insights gained on software development, problem-solving, and the importance of user-centric design.

As this project continues to evolve, I am excited about the possibilities for future enhancements and improvements. QuickGrade is not just a tool for managing grades; it's a testament to the growth and learning that happens when passionate individuals embark on a coding journey.

Thank you, CS50 and Professor David Malan, for the inspiration, challenges, and knowledge that have fueled this project and my overall development as a programmer.
